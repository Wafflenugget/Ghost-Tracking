# Ghost Tracker: A Spooky Adventure for Kids!

This is a ghost hunting web for kids, and it's not THAT scary. Follow these instructions for a thrilling experience:

1. **Go into a pitch-black room** with your friends, family, or alone.
2. **Decide who will read** the screen instructions in a scary voice (only one person). This person should stay outside the room and whisper inside.
3. **Everyone except the reader** should be blindfolded, sitting in a circle while holding hands.
4. **In the center of the circle**, light a red candle. **IMPORTANT**: Do not play once the candle blows out for safety precautions.
5. **To leave or play again**, say: "Oh Dear Mother Mother Mother. I enjoyed playing. May I have permission to leave (or play again)?" 
   - Use a blank paper divided in the middle with "Yes" on one side and "No" on the other. See where the pencil lands.

(Optional) If you want, you can play scary music inside the room.

**Good luck, brave ghost hunters!**
